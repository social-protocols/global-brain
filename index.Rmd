# About

This document contains the collected write-ups and explanations surrounding the
[Y platform](https://github.com/social-protocols/Y), currently created by the
[social protocols organization](https://www.social-protocols.org).

As at this point, Y has not been launched yet and is under rapid development,
this is a living document and the information in it may become outdated fast.
Nonetheless, we try to maintain up-to-date explanations of our ideas here.

In the first few chapters, we will introduce the building blocks of our
algorithms; simple, but important concepts which make up the foundation of the
components from which the Y platform is built.

# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
