# About

This document contains write-ups and explanations on the
[Y platform](https://github.com/social-protocols/Y), currently created by the
[social protocols organization](https://www.social-protocols.org).

At this point, Y has not been launched yet and is under rapid development,
so this is a living document and the information in it may become outdated fast.
Nonetheless, we try to maintain up-to-date explanations of our ideas here.

We will introduce the building blocks of our
algorithms; simple, but important concepts which make up the foundation of the
components from which the Y platform is built.

We are grateful for feedback.
Do not hesitate to send a [mail](mailto:mail@social-protocols.org).

TODO:

- [ ] describe how Y works in broad terms

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
