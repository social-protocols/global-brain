  This is a collection of explanations on the global brain algorithm.
  We explain core concepts in simple terms that help to understand the
  algorithms as a whole.

# About {-}

This document contains write-ups and explanations on the Global Brain
algorithm developed by the [social protocols organization](https://www.social-protocols.org).

A proof of concept of this algorithm is being developed in
[The Social Network of the Future](https://github.com/social-protocols/social-network).
It has not been launched yet and is
under rapid development, so this is a living document and the information in
it may become outdated fast. Nonetheless, we try to maintain up-to-date
explanations of our ideas here.

We will introduce the building blocks of our algorithms; simple, but important
concepts which make up the foundation of the components from which the
new platform is built.

We are grateful for feedback. Do not hesitate to send a
[mail](mailto:mail@social-protocols.org).
