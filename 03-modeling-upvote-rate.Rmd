# Estimating Upvote Rates

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

beta_data <- function(alpha, beta, samples) {
  data.frame(x = seq(0, 1, len = samples)) %>%
    mutate(y = dbeta(x, alpha, beta))
}

theme_sp <- function() {
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(
      fill = "grey90",
      color = "black",
      linewidth = 1
    ),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "grey70"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "grey80"),
  )
}

```

Users on the platform can rate content by adding an **upvote** or a **downvote**.
There are two essential forms of content users can rate:
posts and posts with a note.
For all posts and post/note combinations, we keep a tally of upvotes and downvotes.

```

## The Upvote Rate

The simplest way of using upvotes and downotes for rating a post is to simply
calculate the ratio between them: $upvotes:downvotes$.
Or expressed as the fraction of upvotes over all votes:

$$
\frac{upvotes}{upvotes + downvotes}
$$

We call this rate the **upvote rate**.

You can also think about the upvote rate as an **average vote**.
If we model the upvote rate as a random variable, we might encode upvotes with a
value of $1$ and downvotes with a value of $0$.
A sample post's gathered votes at a certain point in time $t$ might look like
this:

$$
(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
$$

The post has gathered a total of 12 votes of which 3 are upvotes and 9 are
downvotes.
The upvote rate (i.e., the "average" vote) for this sample is:

$$
\rho = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n} = \frac{upvotes}{upvotes + downvotes} = \frac{3}{3 + 9} = 0.25
$$


### Modeling Belief about the "True" Upvote Rate {-}

We assume that each post has a "true" upvote rate that we can only estimate by
collecting data on it (i.e., collecting votes on a post).
We think about the upvote rate as the **probability of a vote being an upvote**.
A suitable model for proportions or probabilities is given by the Beta distribution, thus we model the true upvote rate as a random variable that follows a Beta
distribution:

$$
upvoteRate \sim \beta(upvotes, downvotes)
$$

The Beta distribution has two shape parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ which in our
case are given by our upvote and downvote counts.
To provide a more intuitive understanding of how this distribution models our
upvote rate, here is an example of how it develops for an example post.
We initialize the distribution with a prior of 1 upvote and 1 downvote.
This is equivalent to a uniform distribution:
We assign equal probability to any outcome, i.e., to any upvote rate.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
beta_data(1, 1, 1000) %>%  
  data.frame() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), color = "firebrick", linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 4)) +
  labs(
    title = "After 0 votes",
    x = "p",
    y = "Density",
  ) +
  theme_sp()

```

Now let's use the previous example vote sample from above:

$$
(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
$$

Using the example above, we get the following distributions at different points
in time:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
beta_data(2, 3, 1000) %>%  
  data.frame() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), color = "firebrick", linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 4)) +
  labs(
    title = "After 3 votes: 1 up, 2 down",
    x = "p",
    y = "Density",
  ) +
  theme_sp()

```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
beta_data(3, 5, 1000) %>%  
  data.frame() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), color = "firebrick", linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 4)) +
  labs(
    title = "After 6 votes: 2 up, 4 down",
    x = "p",
    y = "Density",
  ) +
  theme_sp()

```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
beta_data(3, 8, 1000) %>%  
  data.frame() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), color = "firebrick", linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 4)) +
  labs(
    title = "After 9 votes: 2 up, 7 down",
    x = "p",
    y = "Density",
  ) +
  theme_sp()

```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
beta_data(4, 10, 1000) %>%  
  data.frame() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), color = "firebrick", linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 4)) +
  labs(
    title = "After 12 votes: 3 up, 9 down",
    x = "p",
    y = "Density",
  ) +
  theme_sp()

```

The distribution updates and the probability mass becomes more
concentrated around a smaller range of values which means we become more and
more certain about our beliefs about the true upvote rate.
If the post above would develop further with a similar trajectory, the following
could be the outcome after 500 votes:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
beta_data(137, 363, 1000) %>%  
  data.frame() %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = y), color = "firebrick", linewidth = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "After 500 votes: 137 up, 363 down",
    x = "p",
    y = "Density",
  ) +
  theme_sp()

```

We are now relatively certain that the true upvote rate is somewhere between
around 0.2 and 0.3.


## Estimating Upvote Rates: Naive Approach

Now that we can express our beliefs about the true upvote rate, how do we make a
"best guess" at any given point in time?
A naive solution would be to just take the sample upvote rate as introduced
above:

$$
P(U) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n} = \frac{upvotes}{upvotes + downvotes}
$$

This solution is naive because it ignores an important fact:
In the beginning, we have no information about the upvote rate of the post.
Thus, each new arriving vote has an outsized effect on our estimate that just
gets increasingly small over time.
This would result in very erratic estimates in the beginning which would only
smooth out over time.
Here is how the cumulative mean develops for a random vote history with a true
upvote rate of 0.6:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
set.seed(5)
n_votes <- 100
data <- data.frame(
  idx = seq(1, n_votes),
  x = rbinom(n_votes, size = 1, 0.6)
) %>% 
  mutate(cum_mean = cummean(x))

data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = idx, y = cum_mean)) +
  geom_line(color = "firebrick", linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.6, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_text(x = 90, y = 0.65, label = "true upvote rate: 0.6") +
  labs(
    x = "After N votes",
    y = "Cumulative Mean"
  ) +
  theme_sp()

```

If we were to use this metric to compare posts, getting a very high upvote rate
estimate in the early stages of a post would essentially come down to luck.
It might then temporarily fare overly well (or overly poorly) compared to other
posts.
We have to take into account **prior information** to avoid this.


## The Bayesian Average

The Bayesian Average uses a weighted prior estimate of the average to avoid the
erratic shifts in the estimate when there is not a lot of data.
It is calculated as follows:

$$
\frac{Cm + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{C + n}
$$

$C$ is a weight constant and $m$ is our prior belief about the average.
But what does this achieve in concrete terms?

Let's build up to this formula step by step using our example of estimating the
true upvote rate of a post.
First, remember that the sample upvote rate constitutes the "plain" average.
Let's say our dataset $X$ consists of $1$s and $0$s, where $1$ denotes an upvote
and $0$ denotes a downvote.
Then $\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}$ is the *number of upvotes* (because downvotes are
encoded as $0$s) and $n$ is $upvotes + downvotes$, the *total number of votes*.
The plain average is calculated as follows:

$$
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}
$$

Or in concrete terms:

$$
\frac{upvotes}{upvotes + downvotes}
$$

The Bayesian average is thus:

$$
\frac{C \cdot m + upvotes}{C + upvotes + downvotes}
$$

Now, what does it mean that we add $C \cdot m$ to the nominator and $C$ to the
denominator?

Practically, adding these terms to our formula means that we calculate the
cumulative average as if we had collected $C$ votes with an upvote rate of $m$
before we collected the first vote on our post.
If our prior belief about the average is 0.68 and we chose a weighting factor of
10, this would mean that we calculate the average as if we had previously
collected 10 data points which amounted to an upvote rate of exactly 0.68.

Plugging in the values makes this apparent:

$$
\frac{10 \cdot 0.68 + upvotes}{10 + upvotes + downvotes} = \frac{68 + upvotes}{100 + upvotes + downvotes}
$$

Graphically, it looks like this (the light grey line is the plain average for
comparison):

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
set.seed(12)
n_votes <- 100
votes <- rbinom(n_votes, size = 1, 0.6)
data_plain <- data.frame(
  idx = seq(1, n_votes),
  x = votes,
  is_prior = FALSE
) %>% 
  mutate(cum_mean_plain = cummean(x)) %>% 
  union(
    data.frame(
      idx = seq(-9, 0),
      x = NA,
      is_prior = TRUE,
      cum_mean_plain = NA
    )
  ) %>% 
  arrange(idx) %>% 
  select(-x)

data_bayes <- data.frame(
  idx = seq(1, n_votes),
  x = votes,
  is_prior = FALSE
) %>% 
  union(
    data.frame(
      idx = seq(-9, 0),
      x = 0.68,
      is_prior = TRUE
    )
  ) %>% 
  arrange(idx) %>% 
  mutate(cum_mean_bayes = cummean(x)) %>% 
  select(-x)

data_plain %>% 
  left_join(data_bayes, by = c("idx", "is_prior")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(cum_mean_plain, cum_mean_bayes),
    names_to = "metric",
    values_to = "value",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = idx, y = value)) +
  geom_line(aes(alpha = metric), linewidth = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_alpha_manual(
    values = c(
      "cum_mean_bayes" = 1.0,
      "cum_mean_plain" = 0.2
    ),
  ) +
  geom_text(x = 16, y = 0.95, label = "start of data collection") +
  geom_text(x = 90, y = 0.55, label = "true upvote rate", color = "red") +
  geom_text(x = -5, y = 0.72, label = "prior", color = "black") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.6, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(
    x = "After N votes",
    y = "Cumulative Bayesian Average"
  ) +
  theme_sp() +
  theme(legend.position = "None")

```

The cumulative Bayesian average is much less erratic when little data is available.
However, there is an important question left:
How do we chose a good prior and a good weight?

Here is how the Bayesian average develops for different prior beliefs about the
average.
Bayesian averages over time are indicated by light grey lines, the priors chosen
here are 0.1 through 0.9 and the weight is kept constant at 20.
The plain average is overlayed in darker grey for reference.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}

  ) %>%

      bayesian_avg_90
    ),
    names_to = "metric",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(is_bayesian_avg = stringr::str_starts(metric, "bayes"))

data_bayes %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = idx,
      y = value,
