# Objectives and Goals

Before we go into the details of how the Global Brain algorithm evaluates and curates media, let's look at how users can create and interact with the system.
There are three fundamental elements users interface with:

- **Posts**: A piece of media submitted to the platform by a user, just like posts on any other social media platforms.
- **Notes**: A post's note is its top^[We will go deeper into what the "top" reply is later.] reply . It is shown alongside the post to provide helpful context. Any reply to a post can be a note. Replies are posts themselves.
- **Votes**: Users can upvote or downvote posts.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/visual-primitives.png")

```

The basic form of content users can provide on the platform is a post.
In the following explanations, we visually represent a post by a rectangle with
rounded corners like this.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/01-modeling-upvote-rate/post.png")

```

A post is the start of a conversation.
Users can leave replies to posts which then form a conversation thread.
Replies are posts themselves.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/01-modeling-upvote-rate/post-with-replies.png")

```

For each post that has any replies, we try to find the reply that adds the
most useful context to the post.
We call this reply the post's *note*^[in reference to X's Community Notes from
which we took a lot of inspiration].
Obviously, "most useful" is a very vague term and we will go further into our
rationale what the most useful context is later on.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/01-modeling-upvote-rate/promote-top-reply-to-note.png")

```

Users on the platform can rate content by adding an **upvote** or a **downvote**.
There are two essential forms of content users can rate:
posts and posts with a note.
We call those units *Voting Units*.
For each Voting Unit, we keep a tally of upvotes and downvotes.
